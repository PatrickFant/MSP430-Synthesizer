Project: Arpeggiator
Description: An arpeggiator takes an input signal, typically notes from a synthesizer, and builds what is called an arpeggio. An arpeggio is a technique where notes from a chord are played out in sequence, rather than simultaneously. Our device will take an input signal from a set of pushbuttons, which will mimic the keys of a synthesizer. As such, the buttons will be pressed in a way to replicate playing a chord, at which point the arpeggiator will recognize the chord and play these notes in sequence, creating an arpeggio. The output will be played through a speaker connected to the MSP430. The only components required will be the MSP430 itself, pushbuttons, and a speaker. The complexity lies in accounting for the sheer number of possible chords. Using a 12 note scale, there are over 4000 possible chords. With that many possibilities we cannot simply recognize a chord and choose a corresponding array of notes from a set. Therefore, we will need to read the frequency of the inputs and build the progression of notes in real time.
