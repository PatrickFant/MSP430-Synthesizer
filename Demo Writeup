Demo Writeup
For our final project my partner and I have attempted to model a synthesizer using a MSP430. Two of the essential features of a synth are playing glissandos and arpeggios. A glissando is a slide from one pitch to another while an arpeggio plays out the notes of a chord in sequence. As keys, we use 6 external pushbuttons, each representing a note on the E minor pentatonic scale. In addition, we use a potentiometer to control the "velocity" of the slide in glissando mode, and the tempo in arpeggiator mode.

We have two modes for each of the main functions of our device. The first mode is glissando. We use the WDT in timer mode to check the button inputs. Depending on which button is played, TA0CCR0 is incremented or decremented to match the half-period of the note corresponding to that button. The value of the potentiometer (converted using ADC) controls the amount at which TA0CCR0 is changed. Thus a higher potentiometer value will speed up the slide while a lower value will slow down the slide. 

The second mode functions as an arpeggiator. Two or more buttons are pressed to simulate the playing of a chord. Their inputs are read into an array using the WDT timer. This array is then played on an interval (tempo) controlled by the value of the potentiometer. A counter is used to maintain the current position within the note array. This counter is modded with the total number of notes in the chord, creating a loop so that the sequence will repeat from the beginning after reaching the last note. This loop will continue until another chord is played.
